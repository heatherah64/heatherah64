### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Thank you for checking out my personal GitHub! I'm a second year computer science student at Georgia Tech, concentrating in media and information internetworks. I'm interested in web development and app development. Currently, I am working on my personal website and a debt tracker app for Android.
